## CANTILEVER
This repository contains the work completed during my Cantilever internship, organized into two tasks:

Task 1 – Web Scraping & Data Visualization Built a scraper using BeautifulSoup to extract data, processed it with Pandas, exported results to CSV/HTML, and developed a simple Flask app with search functionality and Matplotlib visualizations.

Task 2 – Image Upload & OCR Created a Flask-based application to upload images, perform text extraction (OCR), and display results dynamically with clean UI support.
